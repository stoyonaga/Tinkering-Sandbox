# Introduction

This section covers the Design Theory for Relational Databases. It addresses how to design a database in order to avoid anomalies and redundancy.
There are two types of anomalies that you will need to look out for, being:
1. Update Anomalies
2. Deletion Anomalies

# Notes

Due to the nature of this section being rather notation heavy, the bulk of the section notes have been provided for you in your Recitation document. There have been no signification changes from the last iteration, however, this time I have provided a, "cheat sheet" for the normalization process.
You can use this to remember very important algorithms (i.e., Closure Test, Minimalization) when doing your practice problems.

# Practice Problems 

Practice problems are again, in your Recitation document that was sent out through email to the appropriate participants.
