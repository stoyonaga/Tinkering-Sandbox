# Getting Started with PostgreSQL

Do note that if you are taking EECS3421, you will likely not gain access to your psql account until the first assignment is released.
Thus, you should be investigating and tinkering with SQL in the mean time on your local server!

Assuming that you have already set up your local working environment, these are some commands you should familiarize yourself within the psql terminal:

<table border="1" style = "border-collapse:collapse">
  <tr><th>Terminal Command</th><th>General Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>\d</td><td>Displays the currently active relations.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\i FILE.sql</td><td>Executes all of your SQL commands from the file that was provided.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\! command</td><td>Runs the given command as a normal terminal input.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\q</td><td>Exit out of the psql terminal.</td></tr>
</table>
