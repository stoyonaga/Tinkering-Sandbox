# Youtube-DL Wrapper Script

## Configuration
Welcome to my youtube-dl wrapper script! Please note that the following script was written to interact between wsl2 and a host machine. 
It can also just as easily be configured to run natively without the requirement of wsl2. 

The installation process was written to work seamlessly, assuming that you're running Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS on Windows 10 x86_64.
